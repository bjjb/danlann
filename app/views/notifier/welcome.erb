Welcome to pictures.bjjb.org!

You've signed up for your own online photo gallery, now what?

Well, you probably have a load of photographs lying around on your computer,
on your MP3 player, etc.  Why not zip them all together into a zip file, and
upload them right away?

Simply make the zipfile on your computer, and then upload it as if it were a
photograph.

I plan to add other features when I get some time, such as:

  * Automatically import from your flickr or picassa account
  * Rotate images after they've been uploaded
  * Group images together in batches
  * Pretty slideshows (based on batches) which you can share with friends

...so stay tuned.

Thanks!

JJ
