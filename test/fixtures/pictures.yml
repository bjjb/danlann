    > Named after its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel, the
    > Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in Paris. More than
    > 200,000,000 people have visited the tower since its
    > construction in 1889, including 6,719,200 in 2006,
    > making it the most visited paid monument in the world.
    > Including the 24 m (79 ft) antenna, the structure is 324 m
    > (1,063 ft) high (since 2000), which is equivalent to about
    > 81 levels in a conventional building.

    > At the time of completion in 1889, it was the world's
    > tallest tower — a title it retained until 1930 when New York
    > City's Chrysler Building (319 m — 1,047 ft tall) was
    > completed. The tower is now the fifth-tallest structure
    > in France and the tallest structure in Paris, with the
    > second-tallest being the Tour Montparnasse (210 m, 689 ft).
    > The Tour AXA will be taller still after renovation (225.11
    > m, 738.36 ft), but it is not actually within Paris, being in
    > the nearby suburb of La Défense.

    > The Arc de Triomphe is a monument in Paris, France that
    > stands in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, also
    > known as the "Place de l'Étoile". It is at the western end
    > of the Champs-Élysées. The triumphal arch honors those who

    > On the inside and the top of the arc there are all of the
    > names of generals and wars fought. Underneath is the tomb of
    > the unknown soldier from World War I.

    > historique) — a sequence of monuments and grand
    > thoroughfares on a route which goes from the courtyard of
    > the Louvre Palace to the outskirts of Paris. The monument
    > was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806, and its iconographic

    > World War I.

    > The monument stands 49.5 m (162 ft) in height, 45 m (150 ft)
    > wide and 22 m (72 ft) deep. The large vault is 29.19 m (95.8

    My dog scruffy is asleep on the carpet in front of the fire.
    He likes to keep warm that way. He is very lazy, but that is
    only because he is very old.

    This is my cat Cleo. She is stuck up in a tree. She is very
    good at climbing up trees, but she is not very good at
    coming back down.

    I think she just likes being in the tree.
