= The Story

The application was set up one month ago, by Bob. Bob is an administrator. The
first thing he did was upload the images eifel_tower and larc_de_triomphe,
which he tagged with "paris" and "travel".

Subsequently, cecil and david have signed up. Cecil uploaded some pictures of
his holiday in Mexico, which he tagged with "mexico" and "travel", and David
uploaded some pictures of his cats and dogs (labeled "pets" and either "cats"
or "dogs").

David wants everyone to see his pets, so he's shared that tag with Cecil and
another unregistered user.
